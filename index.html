        <h2>Platform Overview</h2>

        <p>
            MediVolt is an AI-driven healthcare energy intelligence platform developed to help
            medical institutions analyze, predict, and optimize energy consumption.
            Hospitals operate continuously and require reliable power systems
            to support critical care units, diagnostics, surgical environments, and
            climate-controlled infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
            The platform transforms structured energy data into meaningful insights,
            enabling administrators to improve efficiency, reduce waste,
            and align operational planning with sustainability goals.

    <h2>What MediVolt Does</h2>

    <div class="feature-grid">

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Carbon Emission Estimation</h3>
            <div class="feature-content">
                MediVolt converts electricity consumption data into measurable
                carbon emission equivalents using standardized emission factors.
                This allows healthcare facilities to understand their environmental
                footprint, track sustainability progress, and support green
                compliance initiatives with accurate reporting metrics.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Advanced Energy Pattern Analysis</h3>
            <div class="feature-content">
                The platform evaluates historical energy consumption records to
                identify recurring usage trends, departmental load distribution,
                and performance irregularities. By recognizing consumption patterns,
                hospitals can better manage operational load and prevent
                unnecessary energy wastage.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Predictive Demand Forecasting</h3>
            <div class="feature-content">
                Using AI-based forecasting models, MediVolt anticipates future
                peak energy intervals. This proactive forecasting enables
                administrators to prepare infrastructure in advance,
                stabilize load demand, and avoid costly peak surcharges.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Energy Optimization Recommendations</h3>
            <div class="feature-content">
                MediVolt generates structured optimization insights that guide
                energy balancing strategies, reduce inefficiencies, and improve
                cost management. These recommendations are based on real
                consumption data trends and predictive analysis.
            </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Anomaly Detection & Risk Identification</h3>
            <div class="feature-content">
                The system continuously evaluates deviations from normal
                consumption patterns. Sudden spikes or irregularities
                are flagged to support early intervention, helping prevent
                operational disruptions and equipment strain.
            </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Strategic Energy Planning Support</h3>
            <div class="feature-content">
                Beyond daily monitoring, MediVolt supports long-term
                infrastructure planning by analyzing performance trends
                over extended periods. This enables healthcare institutions
                to align operational expansion with sustainable energy goals.
